                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello there,</p>

                <p>As you may already know, my name is Antonio Gleyser, a second-year software engineering student at iCEV, in Brazil. Currently, my forte is front-end development, specializing in languages such as <strong>JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</strong>. I've - recently - been immersed in some exciting projects, including the creation of this portfolio as part of my front-end development studies. Additionally, my interest extends to Artificial Intelligence, as demonstrated by the chess software I developed for a competition, winning three matches and losing one – not due to any errors in the software, but rather human error.</p>

                <p>My coding journey commenced in 2018 during my first class in another course – aerospace engineering. Life took an unexpected turn, leading me into the realm of software development. Outside of this world, you'll often find me indulging in video games, watching and reading science-fiction,  and contributing to charitable causes for the less fortunate. It's not just about the code; it's about creating something meaningful and impactful.</p>

                <p>Looking into the future, my goal is to evolve into a full-stack engineer. I am particularly and genuinely passionate about Artificial Intelligence – it is the future, web development – where my creativity reaches its peak, and anything else that captures my interest in this vast realm.</p>
